# Computational_Homology
Implementing algorithms from Kaczynski's Computational Homology.
After many years, this project is being updated with tools from LinBox to improve the efficiency of the homology algorithms.

This project arose from the topology/geometry seminar at Oregon State University in 2019.
I worked with Danny Wentland and Chung-Ping Lai to introduce the seminar to topological data analysis, with the guidance of our advisor Dr. Christine Escher.
My contribution was to learn and implement the basic features of computational cubical homology, including homology computations on n-dimensional cubes and performing elementary reductions to make those computations more efficient.
Although this project is nowhere near-performant enough for real applications, it was a great way to learn the foundational techniques in the field.
For an infinitely more robust cubical homology package, take a look at CHoMP.
